            Cook your noodles so that they are al dente with some bite. For most noodles, this means cooking just a few minutes in boiling water, but thinner noodles, like may just need to be soaked.
        </p>
        <p>
            The trick to perfect noodle stir-fry is to cook the noodles until they are al dente or just slightly undercooked and then when drained, rinse them with cold water to stop the cooking process.
        </p>
        <p>
            Doing it this way will prevent the noodles from getting overcooked and soggy when you add them to the stir-fry.

            Noodles stir-fry better if you shake them after draining until dry as possible. They shouldnâ€™t be wet to the touch.
        <br>
            To keep your noodles from sticking before adding to the wok, add them back to their pot after draining and toss them with a little sesame oil or cooking oil.

                A traditional Chow Mein has boiled noodles that are stir-fried until slightly crisped, while Lo Mein is boiled then tossed in a sauce without cooking the noodles in the wok.
                </p>

                The noodles in Lo Mein and Chow Mein are about the same, both use egg noodles, but Lo Mein noodles are sometimes thicker.
